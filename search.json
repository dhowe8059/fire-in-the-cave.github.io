The rational case for waiting was clear: prices were high ($3,500-4,000), supplies were limited, post-holiday sales might come. Every logical analysis said wait.\nBut the nervousness persisted. And I’ve learned not to ignore that signal.\nThis is how pattern recognition works when you don’t yet know what pattern you’re detecting.\nDuring this time, silver started increasing in price. I watched the price climb from Black Friday through Christmas. Prices climbing and then dropping. Silver is known for volatility but I had observed nothing like this over the last 10 years.\nI started watching more. Trying to figure out what could be driving this behavior."

    "text": "Market Structure Tells a Story\nGold and silver have long been purchased by those worried that US Government debt may lead to currency inflation. BRICS and other countries have been de-dollarizing for years. These factors have been present for a long time and silver prices maintained a trading range throughout.\nData centers, solar panels, EVs and batteries have been increasing demand for silver. But again, you would expect gradual price increases over months or years. Not dollar and multi-dollar swings in a day. This was new.\nThe markets are more complicated than just watching stock prices. For US customers:\n\nLBMA (London Bullion Market Association) - buy contracts, can have metal delivered\nCOMEX (Commodity Exchange Inc.) - futures and options, betting on price movements\n\nSMM (Shanghai Metals Market) - spot prices for physical metal\n\nNormally, COMEX prices would be higher than LBMA or SMM since futures include storage costs.\nBut the pattern was inverted: LBMA prices were higher than COMEX, with SMM prices greater than LBMA. The spreads were $4.00 or higher for SMM versus LBMA.\nThis implies physical metal buying is driving the price—not investment products.\nI didn’t understand the mechanics behind this. But silver is needed for electrical and computer components, AI data centers, batteries, green energy technologies, electrical infrastructure. Why the sudden increase in physical buying?\nFrom September through November 2025, silver increased from approximately $40 to $60. From Christmas Eve to the day after Christmas, it jumped another $8.\nOne has to be careful interpreting holiday price moves—fewer traders. But SMM still had metals being purchased at premium prices. Normally, arbitrage would eliminate this—buy from COMEX and LBMA, sell at SMM. This wasn’t happening."

I was monitoring GPU prices and availability. Prices didn’t drop after Christmas and no new supplies were coming in.\nI got lucky—an article came out suggesting how to pick the right LLM to run on a Mac. I looked at computers available at the local Mac store and found an M3 Mac Studio with 96 GB memory. Not the fastest at fine-tuning, but for running larger models it can handle more than an RTX5090. And the price was the same as just the GPU alone.\nI bought it December 26th."

But I didn’t yet understand what that pattern was revealing about the system itself.\nThe full picture emerged over the next week.\nFirst, more details about China’s silver policy became clear: companies needed capacity for 80+ tons annually, credit lines exceeding $30M, state approval for all exports. Combined with the US listing silver as a Critical Mineral on November 7th, industrial users were scrambling.\nThen on January 3rd, the geopolitical driver became visible: US military conducted special operations in Venezuela, removing President Maduro and his wife. The stated justification: drug trafficking, democracy, cartel operations.\nThe actual strategic asset: Venezuela holds massive rare earth deposits—plus significant gold, copper, and silver production. Silver is often a byproduct of gold and copper mining operations.\nChina had been accessing these minerals through existing cartel arrangements. The US operation disrupted that access—just three months after China announced their own export restrictions on materials they control.\nSuddenly the market behavior I’d been tracking made sense:\n\nChina restricts silver exports they control (October 26)\nMarkets begin scrambling for alternative supply sources (my November-December volatility signal)\nPhysical premiums spike as buyers need actual delivery, not paper contracts\nUS moves to secure alternative supply sources China was accessing (January 3)\n\nMy GPU nervousness wasn’t about Nvidia supply chains specifically.

Recently, I turned that same training on my own life to discover why, despite outward success, I didn’t feel happy or fulfilled. Along the way, I found that these pattern recognition skills work just as well for seeing through systemic illusions.\nYou may wonder why the title Fire in the Cave.\nThe image holds multiple fractals:\nPaleolithic star-painters — In her book The Human Cosmos, Jo Marchant describes how cave paintings may not just depict animals important to survival, but stars that tracked when the herds would come. Pattern recognition as survival technology, passed down across generations.\nPlato’s prisoners — Chained in a cave, taught the world via shadows controlled by their jailers. One escaped to the outside, discovered the lies, returned to free the others—and faced their disbelief.\nPrometheus — Stole fire from the gods to give humanity light, warmth, tools, civilization. The name means “forethought”—the one who sees what’s coming.\nHence, the atmosphere of the fire in the cave. Looking for truth not from the shadows generated, but by the fire illuminating the patterns we paint on the walls. Looking to find mine, yours, and hopefully our truth."

    "text": "The Demonstration\nZander began by working with a few students from the Music School. Each one played a solo for him. He stopped them and just started talking about the emotion of that piece and how you could change it. He started talking to the musician, not about technique, but an emotional feeling. They played again and the changes were amazing. A different aspect or way of feeling greatly improved their playing style.\nHe did this with each student. Really having an impact on each performer. Then as he was talking to the crowd, he played the movie for the hidden gorilla experiment.\nYou’ve probably seen it—or think you have. A group of people in a video pass basketballs back and forth. Your job: count the number of passes.\nMidway through, a person in a gorilla suit walks directly through the middle of the players. Stops. Beats their chest. Walks off.\nAbout half the people watching miss it completely. I was in that half.\nZander told us to watch for the gorilla. I thought he was making another joke. He replayed the clip. There it was—a person in a full gorilla suit, standing in the center of the frame, impossible to miss once you knew to look for it.\nHow had I not seen that?\nThe point, Zander explained, was that you can miss things completely when you limit your sense of what’s possible. When you’re focused on counting passes, your brain filters out gorillas. Even obvious ones. Even ones standing right in front of you.\nGreat lesson. Pretty obvious once someone tells you what to look for.",

You have all these opportunities.” They were right. By conventional measures, I was doing fine. Better than fine.\nLooking back at that Zander presentation, I realized something. I saw the gorilla only after Zander told me what to look for. Once you know what to look for, the problem becomes obvious. Maybe not easy to solve—but at least you have something to work on.\nBut what if no one knows what to look for? Not even you?\nWhat if your path—your specific design, your unique alignment—is something no one can describe to you because it’s uniquely yours? Your parents can’t tell you what to look for. Your boss can’t. Career counselors can’t. Because YOUR gorilla is different from theirs. Hidden in your own data. Visible only to you, once you learn to see it.\nSo how do you develop the ability to see what you don’t even know to look for?\nHow do you notice the signal when you don’t know what signal you’re searching for?\nHow do you recognize alignment when you’ve never experienced it before?\nThat’s the methodological problem.\nAnd it’s the problem I’ve spent the last several years trying to solve—first for myself, then realizing others face the same challenge.",

Multiple data sources. Pattern recognition. Convergent evidence. Following signals even when I didn’t know what I was looking for.\nThis book is the result of that experiment.\nIt operates at three scales:\nPersonal — How to develop the capacity to see patterns in your own life that no one else can show you, because your alignment is uniquely yours.\nSystemic — The same methodology applied to collective patterns: why millions are opting out of institutional bargains, what the Fourth Turning actually reveals, and where the fault lines really lie.\nArchitectural — What comes next. The infrastructure that doesn’t yet exist for a genuinely decentralized alternative.\nThis isn’t inspiration. It’s methodology.\nThe fire illuminates the patterns we paint on the walls—not the shadows cast by those who claim to know what’s coming.\nCome sit.
