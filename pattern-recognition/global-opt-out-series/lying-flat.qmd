## The Global Pattern — Lying Flat

I came across a recent article by the Epoch Times, [Seeing no hope for the future China’s Youth are Choosing Failure](https://www.theepochtimes.com/article/seeing-no-hope-for-the-future-chinas-youth-are-choosing-failure-5967095).

### The Signal

33 hours on a mattress. No bathroom breaks. The winner wore a diaper.

10 million people tuned in to watch the live-streamed contest in Inner Mongolia. The event name was “Tangping”—Lying Flat.

“Finally,” one commenter wrote, “lying flat has become the way to win.”

It is easy to dismiss this as a stunt. It isn’t. In signal processing, we look for anomalies that repeat until they become the baseline. This is that anomaly.

### The Mechanism

“Lying Flat” emerged four years ago, initially as a reaction to draconian COVID lockdowns. But when the lockdowns lifted, the behavior didn’t snap back. It calcified.

They call themselves “rat people.” Based on social media scraping, the routine is consistent: crawl out of bed at noon, shower, eat while scrolling, back to bed, gaming, doom scrolling until 3 AM.

The Cyberspace Administration of China responded the only way a rigid system knows how: they banned the influencers from covering Tangping. They declared the lifestyle “unhealthy” and a violation of “core socialist values.”

But you cannot ban a mathematical output. If the energy required to participate in the system exceeds the energy returned by the system, the organism stops moving. It is not rebellion. It is conservation of energy.

### The Data Points

The “Rat People” are not the uneducated underclass. They are the system’s best products.

**The Oxford Delivery Driver**: He was a straight-A student. Tsinghua University on scholarship. Master’s degree from Oxford. He did everything the equation asked him to do. Now, he wears the bright yellow uniform of Meituan, delivering takeout noodles to office workers who are still hoping the math works. During exam season, he posted a video on WeChat telling high school students to “keep a level head.” “Whether you score high or low,” he said, “our work won’t be all that different.”

**The Finance Barista**: A graduate of Shandong University. Finance degree. Strong internships. She followed the “Competence Trap” perfectly—developing skills for a market that no longer exists. “I’ve sent over 300 resumes. Only two firms got back.” She now sells drinks at a relative’s kiosk. She makes less than 100 yuan per day—about \$14. She isn’t lazy. She is market-corrected.

**The Scavenger**: Not long ago, scavenging was a signal of destitution. Now, it is a “Life Hack.” Young people scour the dumpsters of wholesale markets for discarded vegetables. A wholesaler observed, “Whenever something gets dumped out, it’s snatched away. You have to come early.” A news anchor tried to spin this as “discovering the simple joys in life.” It is actually “Zero Cost Survival.”

### The Regression

When a system cannot support adult milestones, the population regresses.

The marriage rate has been falling for a decade. The government throws shopping vouchers and cash at the problem, trying to stimulate demand for families. “Marriage is for rich people,” one youth said. “What will our children eat? Will there be money for baby formula?”

This summer, adult pacifiers trended. Young people wear them as fashion accessories or sleep aids. They call themselves “Baobao” (Baby) to strangers in cafes.

In 2025, universities began holding parent-teacher meetings. Hospitals opened clinics for students “who hate school,” with waitlists stretching months. The society is infantilizing itself because the adult world has become uninhabitable.

### The System Response

The government is scared. You can tell they are scared because they stopped counting.

In August 2023, youth unemployment hit 21.3%. One in five. Beijing stopped publishing the data. Five months later, the data returned with a new formula: “Students don’t count.” They removed 62 million people from the denominator. The number magically dropped to the mid-teens. But removing the gauge doesn’t lower the pressure in the boiler. Internal memos from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences warn that youth may move “from the internet to the streets.” On New Year’s Eve, cities canceled celebrations to prevent large gatherings. They know the fuel is on the ground.

### The Pattern

This quote got my mind spinning: ”*I don’t want to lie flat, but trying doesn’t seem to get me anywhere. I used to think that people don’t work because they are lazy. Now I know they have no place to go.*”

This is the Fourth Turning in real-time (Strauss and Howe, The Fourth Turning (1997)). We are looking at a “Competence Trap” on a national scale. Millions of youth invested in high-competence skills (Oxford degrees, Finance degrees) only to find the environment had shifted to a low-competence reality (delivery driving, scavenging).

Shenzhen housing is 43x median income. 300 resumes = 2 responses. \$14 a day for a finance major.

They did the math. The math said “No.” So they lay down.

### **The Global Mirror**

If you think this is a “China problem,” check your own local feed. Scroll through TikTok or YouTube shorts in the United States. You won’t see “Tangping,” but you will see “Quiet Quitting.” You will see “Rotting in Bed.” You will see the “NEET” (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) phenomenon.

The variables are different—we don’t have the CCP, and they don’t have the Federal Reserve—but the equation is solving for the same result.

This may seem to be a change in direction from my previous entries, but detecting your gorilla is the first step. The hardest step is confirming that is your gorilla. I assume this is a continual process as we mature. Each iteration taking both time and your attention to navigate — and outside forces are always present that could derail the process of finding your happiness.

**Next:** The same pattern is appearing in Korea, Japan, and Europe. We need to look at the “Hikikomori” next.
