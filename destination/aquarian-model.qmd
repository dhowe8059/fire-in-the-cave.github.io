*Coming soon.*

The current economic model assumes:

- Value flows to centers (corporations, platforms, institutions)
- Individuals are users on someone else's infrastructure
- Credentials require institutional validation
- Knowledge is extracted, aggregated, and resold

The Aquarian model inverts this:

- Value created and exchanged at the edges
- Individuals as sovereign nodes
- Peer-to-peer validation and credentialing
- Knowledge remains with its creator, monetized directly

This isn't ideology. It's architecture.

This article will cover:

- Why the current extraction model is structurally unstable
- What "nodes and edges" actually means in practice
- How blockchain enables sovereignty without requiring trust
- The transition path from here to there
