## The Hidden Extraction

When you use cloud-based AI, your prompts—the questions you ask, the problems you're solving, the creative directions you're exploring—become training data. Your intellectual work gets extracted to improve models that others profit from.

This isn't a conspiracy. It's the business model.

## The Alternative

Local AI inverts this:

- **Your hardware, your data** — Prompts never leave your machine
- **Your models, your control** — Fine-tune for your specific needs
- **Your intellectual property, your sovereignty** — No extraction, no surveillance

This article will cover:

- The economics of local vs. cloud AI
- Hardware requirements and practical setup
- What you gain and what you trade off
- How local AI connects to the broader Aquarian architecture
