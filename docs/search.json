    "text": "Tools I Use\n\nThe Fire in the Cave Stack\nEverything here is free or low-cost. Nothing requires a computer science degree. I use these tools daily — for research, analysis, writing, publishing, and running local AI models. The stack is the methodology in practice.\n\n\nPublishing & Websites\nQuarto — Open-source scientific publishing system. Renders markdown into websites, books, presentations, and reports (word documents and PDFs). Embeds live Python and R code so calculations stay current. This is what data scientists use for reproducible research. It’s what I use to publish everything you read here.\nGitHub Pages — Free static site hosting through GitHub. The fireinthecave.com site lives here. Version-controlled, meaning every edit is tracked and reversible. No hosting fees. No ads. No platform algorithm deciding who sees your content.\nPinata — IPFS pinning service. Hosts files on a distributed network rather than a single server. The fireinthecave.x site runs through Pinata. Content persists across multiple nodes — no single point of failure.\nUnstoppable Domains — Blockchain-based domain registration. The .x domain resolves through blockchain rather than traditional DNS. No registrar can revoke it. You own the domain outright — one purchase, no renewal fees.\n\n\nWriting & Research\nObsidian — Local-first knowledge management. All notes stored as plain markdown files on your machine — no cloud dependency. The wikilink system lets you build connections between ideas the way your brain actually works. My research vault connects silver market data to Vedic astrology frameworks to Fourth Turning cycle analysis. The links reveal patterns that linear note-taking hides.\nNovelcrafter — Writing tool with a built-in Codex system for world-building. I use it to maintain cross-references across the entire Fire in the Cave framework — characters, concepts, timelines, methodology entries. Every term that appears in my writing has a Codex entry with analytical edges, narrative edges, and relational links. The Codex is the spine of the project.\nZotero — Free, open-source reference manager. Captures citations from the web, organizes sources, generates bibliographies. Essential for maintaining the evidentiary standard. If I cite a BLS report or a Cabinet Office survey, Zotero keeps the receipt.\n\n\nDevelopment & Analysis\nPositron — IDE (integrated development environment) from Posit, the company behind RStudio. Handles both Python and R in a single environment. This is where Quarto projects get built and where analytical code runs before publication.\nVS Code — Microsoft’s free code editor. Handles everything from markdown editing to Git operations to terminal commands. If Positron is the laboratory, VS Code is the workshop.\nR Studio — The original IDE for R statistical computing. Still useful for specific R-based analyses and Quarto rendering.\nPython / R — The two languages behind every calculation, chart, and model on these sites. Python handles the heavy lifting (PyHora for Vedic chart calculations, data manipulation, API calls). R handles statistical modeling and visualization. Both are used for producing visualizations.\n\n\nAI & Local Models\nMac Studio (M3, 96GB) — The hardware. Unified memory architecture means large language models that won’t fit on a GPU’s VRAM run comfortably here. This is the machine from the December positioning story — bought ahead of silver-driven supply chain disruption.\nLocal LLMs — Models running on-device rather than through cloud APIs. No data leaves the machine. No usage fees per query. No terms of service changes that could cut access. The same sovereignty principle that applies to publishing applies to AI: if you don’t control the infrastructure, you don’t control the capability.\nProprietary LLMs — Cloud APIs are used. These include Claude, Gemini, NotebookLM and Perplexity. I am developing Local LLMs and looking at how to include Cloud APIs to get the best of both worlds. This is an experiment in progress and will provide updates and how I use the models including prompting. All outputs are stored in Obsidian for knowledge base and further utilization.\n\n\nPhenotypic Assessment\nPyHora — Python library for Vedic astrological chart calculations. Generates divisional chart data (vargas) as structured JSON output. This is the computational engine behind the phenotypic assessment system — not a horoscope generator, but a pattern-mapping tool that I test rigorously against observable outcomes.\n\n\n\nThe Principle Behind the Stack\nEvery tool listed here shares three properties:\n\nYou own the output. No platform lock-in. Files are markdown, JSON, plain text. If any tool disappears tomorrow, your work survives.\nThe cost barrier is near zero. Most of this is free. The Mac Studio was a one-time hardware purchase. There are no monthly subscriptions gating your ability to publish, analyze, or think.\nNo permission required. You don’t need an editor to approve your post. You don’t need a hosting company to keep your site live. You don’t need a cloud provider to run your models. The tools serve you. You don’t serve the tools.\n\nThis isn’t a flex. It’s a proof of concept. If a PK/PD modeler who grew up on a farm can build this stack, so can you. You are not on your own. I was able to set up using Cloud API LLMs. I cannot stress this enough. You have access to help to set up these tools. This help is getting better and better over time. The tools exist.\nThe barrier isn’t technical — it’s the assumption that you need someone else’s platform to do serious work.\nYou don’t."

    "section": "The Global Pattern — Lying Flat",
    "text": "The Global Pattern — Lying Flat\nI came across a recent article by the Epoch Times, Seeing no hope for the future China’s Youth are Choosing Failure.\n\nThe Signal\n33 hours on a mattress. No bathroom breaks. The winner wore a diaper.\n10 million people tuned in to watch the live-streamed contest in Inner Mongolia. The event name was “Tangping”—Lying Flat.\n“Finally,” one commenter wrote, “lying flat has become the way to win.”\nIt is easy to dismiss this as a stunt. It isn’t. In signal processing, we look for anomalies that repeat until they become the baseline. This is that anomaly.\n\n\nThe Mechanism\n“Lying Flat” emerged four years ago, initially as a reaction to draconian COVID lockdowns. But when the lockdowns lifted, the behavior didn’t snap back. It calcified.\nThey call themselves “rat people.” Based on social media scraping, the routine is consistent: crawl out of bed at noon, shower, eat while scrolling, back to bed, gaming, doom scrolling until 3 AM.\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China responded the only way a rigid system knows how: they banned the influencers from covering Tangping. They declared the lifestyle “unhealthy” and a violation of “core socialist values.”\nBut you cannot ban a mathematical output. If the energy required to participate in the system exceeds the energy returned by the system, the organism stops moving. It is not rebellion. It is conservation of energy.\n\n\nThe Data Points\nThe “Rat People” are not the uneducated underclass. They are the system’s best products.\nThe Oxford Delivery Driver: He was a straight-A student. Tsinghua University on scholarship. Master’s degree from Oxford. He did everything the equation asked him to do. Now, he wears the bright yellow uniform of Meituan, delivering takeout noodles to office workers who are still hoping the math works. During exam season, he posted a video on WeChat telling high school students to “keep a level head.” “Whether you score high or low,” he said, “our work won’t be all that different.”\nThe Finance Barista: A graduate of Shandong University. Finance degree. Strong internships. She followed the “Competence Trap” perfectly—developing skills for a market that no longer exists. “I’ve sent over 300 resumes. Only two firms got back.” She now sells drinks at a relative’s kiosk. She makes less than 100 yuan per day—about $14. She isn’t lazy. She is market-corrected.\nThe Scavenger: Not long ago, scavenging was a signal of destitution. Now, it is a “Life Hack.” Young people scour the dumpsters of wholesale markets for discarded vegetables. A wholesaler observed, “Whenever something gets dumped out, it’s snatched away. You have to come early.” A news anchor tried to spin this as “discovering the simple joys in life.” It is actually “Zero Cost Survival.”\n\n\nThe Regression\nWhen a system cannot support adult milestones, the population regresses.\nThe marriage rate has been falling for a decade. The government throws shopping vouchers and cash at the problem, trying to stimulate demand for families. “Marriage is for rich people,” one youth said. “What will our children eat? Will there be money for baby formula?”\nThis summer, adult pacifiers trended. Young people wear them as fashion accessories or sleep aids. They call themselves “Baobao” (Baby) to strangers in cafes.\nIn 2025, universities began holding parent-teacher meetings. Hospitals opened clinics for students “who hate school,” with waitlists stretching months. The society is infantilizing itself because the adult world has become uninhabitable.\n\n\nThe System Response\nThe government is scared. You can tell they are scared because they stopped counting.\nIn August 2023, youth unemployment hit 21.3%. One in five. Beijing stopped publishing the data. Five months later, the data returned with a new formula: “Students don’t count.” They removed 62 million people from the denominator. The number magically dropped to the mid-teens. But removing the gauge doesn’t lower the pressure in the boiler. Internal memos from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences warn that youth may move “from the internet to the streets.” On New Year’s Eve, cities canceled celebrations to prevent large gatherings. They know the fuel is on the ground.\n\n\nThe Pattern\nThis quote got my mind spinning: ”I don’t want to lie flat, but trying doesn’t seem to get me anywhere. I used to think that people don’t work because they are lazy. Now I know they have no place to go.”\nThis is the Fourth Turning in real-time (Strauss and Howe, The Fourth Turning (1997)). We are looking at a “Competence Trap” on a national scale. Millions of youth invested in high-competence skills (Oxford degrees, Finance degrees) only to find the environment had shifted to a low-competence reality (delivery driving, scavenging).\nShenzhen housing is 43x median income. 300 resumes = 2 responses. $14 a day for a finance major.\nThey did the math. The math said “No.” So they lay down.\n\n\nThe Global Mirror\nIf you think this is a “China problem,” check your own local feed. Scroll through TikTok or YouTube shorts in the United States. You won’t see “Tangping,” but you will see “Quiet Quitting.” You will see “Rotting in Bed.” You will see the “NEET” (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) phenomenon.\nThe variables are different—we don’t have the CCP, and they don’t have the Federal Reserve—but the equation is solving for the same result.\nThis may seem to be a change in direction from my previous entries, but detecting your gorilla is the first step. The hardest step is confirming that is your gorilla. I assume this is a continual process as we mature. Each iteration taking both time and your attention to navigate — and outside forces are always present that could derail the process of finding your happiness.\nNext: The same pattern is appearing in Korea, Japan, and Europe. We need to look at the “Hikikomori” next.\nThis is part of an ongoing series on pattern recognition at personal and systemic scales. If you’re detecting similar signals, subscribe to follow along as 2026 unfolds.\n\nThis is part of an ongoing series on the systemic shifts unfolding in 2026. Subscribe to follow along.",

    "text": "Biomarker\nIt was late December 2025, and I was watching GPU prices for a new AI workstation. The rational case for waiting was clear: prices were high ($3,500-4,000), supplies were limited, post-holiday sales might come. Every logical analysis said wait.\nBut the nervousness persisted. And I’ve learned not to ignore that signal.\nThis is how pattern recognition works when you don’t yet know what pattern you’re detecting.\nThis may seem not relevant, but during this time. Silver starting increasing in price. I started watching the price continue to climb from Black Friday through Christmas. Prices climbing and then dropping. Silver is known for volatility but I have observed nothing like this over the last 10 years.\nI started watching more. Trying to figure out what could be a driver for this behavior. Gold and silver have long been purchased by those that worry that the amount of debt by the US Government may lead to the inflation of the currency. Recently, BRICS and other countries are decreasing their purchases of US Treasuries or de-dollarizing for transactions. These have been happening for many years and silver prices have maintained a trading range over this time.\nData centers, solar panels, EVs and batteries like Samsung’s new solid state battery have been increasing the demand for silver. Again, maybe you would observe a constant price increase over months or yearly. Not observing dollar and multi-dollar swing in prices in a day. This was new. The other is the markets are a little more complicated than looking at the stock market. For US customers, the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) where one can buy contracts that can have metal delivered and the other is the Commodity Exchange Inc. (COMEX). The COMEX is a leading North American futures and options exchange for trading precious and base metals. You are investing or betting on price movements on COMEX. Another exchange that appeared to be playing a larger role during this time is the Shanghai Metals Market (SMM) which gives spot prices or prices for the metal. Normally, one would expect COMEX prices to be higher than LBMA or SMM prices since for COMEX you are looking at future prices and costs for storage would be included versus the present value representing by LBMA or SMM.",

    "text": "Market Structure Tells a Story\nLBMA prices were higher than COMEX with SMM prices greater than LBMA. The spreads or differences were $4.00 or higher for SMM versus LBMA over this time. This implies that physical metal buying is driving the price and not investment products. I did not understand the mechanics behind this, but silver is a need for electrical and computer components among other important products like AI data centers, batteries, green energy technologies, electrical infrastructure. Why all of a sudden the increase in physical buying. The silver price has been gradually increasing since September 2025 going from approximately $40 to $50 over the month. For the month of November it increased another $10 over the month. From Christmas Eve to the day after Christmas, Silver price increased $8 dollars. The SMM and other exchanges had large premiums as compared to COMEX and LBMA.\nFigure 1. Daily COMEX Silver Prices from February 2024 through January 5, 2026\n\n\n\nsilver price\n\n\nNote the unusual volatility beginning in November and the $8 spike over Christmas - behavior unlike anything in the previous 10 years.\nOne has to be careful with interpreting price moves over the holidays since there are fewer traders, but the SMM still had metals being purchased and driving prices up at the SMM. Normally, this would not last because someone would purchase from COMEX and LBMA and sell at the SMM to take advantage of the price differential. This was not happening. Even on the days that extreme selling seem to be happening. The price at the SMM was reduced, but still higher than either the COMEX or LBMA.",

I was monitoring GPU prices and availability at a few sites. Prices did not drop after Christmas and no new supplies coming in yet. I just got lucky and an article came out in Medium. I did not read it, but the title suggested that the article was geared towards picking right LLM (Large language models) to run on your Mac. I looked at the computers that were available at the local Mac store and found an M3 Mac Studio with 96 GB memory. It is not the fastest at fine tuning new models, but for initial training it can run much bigger models than the RTX5090 can do. Also, the price for the computer was the same price as just the RTX5090 GPU. Went out and bought it.",

    "text": "The Signal I Didn’t Yet Understand\nI made this purchase on December 26th - smart positioning based on the pattern I could see in silver markets. But I didn’t yet understand what that pattern was revealing about the system itself.\nThe full picture emerged over the next week.\nFirst, more details about China’s silver policy became clear: companies needed capacity for 80+ tons annually, credit lines exceeding $30M, state approval for all exports. Combined with the US listing silver as a Critical Mineral on November 7th, industrial users were scrambling.\nThen on January 3rd, the geopolitical driver became visible: US military conducted special operations in Venezuela, removing President Maduro and his wife. The stated justification: drug trafficking, democracy, cartel operations.\nThe actual strategic asset: Venezuela holds massive rare earth deposits - plus significant gold, copper, and silver production. Silver is often a byproduct of gold and copper mining operations.\nChina had been accessing these minerals through existing cartel arrangements. The US operation disrupted that access - just three months after China announced their own export restrictions on materials they control.\nSuddenly the market behavior I’d been tracking made sense:\nChina restricts silver exports they control (October 26)\nMarkets begin scrambling for alternative supply sources (my November-December volatility signal)\nPhysical premiums spike as buyers need actual delivery, not paper contracts\nUS moves to secure alternative supply sources China was accessing (January 3)\nMy GPU nervousness wasn’t about Nvidia supply chains specifically. My biomarker was detecting systemic fragmentation of the entire mineral supply infrastructure feeding tech manufacturing.\nYou might think this is doom scrolling. Overreacting. ‘Everything will be fine, prices will normalize.’ The price action after the one - two punch shows a manic reaction by those that need silver and willing to pay for it. I would recommend watching how this transpires in 2026. I have watched videos and looked at analysis but these mostly look at the price of silver.\nSilver is used in a wide variety of products. Silver is a important metal for EVs, solar panels, batteries, electrical connections in AI data centers. High quality silver paste is used high end chip production at the final stage. With both China and US military limiting silver access, here are some other areas possibly affected.\n\nSilver Usage in AI & Legacy Chips Advanced Packaging (CoWoS)\n\nThe Material: Die Attach Paste (80%+ Silver)\nThe Function: Glues the AI silicon to the substrate; essential for heat transfer in high-power GPUs (like Nvidia H100).\nThe Choke Point: This paste requires ultra-fine, nano-scale silver powder refined almost exclusively in China/Japan. No paste = no finished GPU.\nWafer Coating\nThe Material: Sputtering Targets (5N Purity)\nThe Function: Ultra-pure silver discs bombarded with ions to create microscopic conductive layers on the silicon wafer.\nThe Choke Point: Requires 99.999% purity. Chinese refiners dominate the capacity to produce this specific “High Purity” grade cheaply.\nInterconnects\nThe Material: Solder Bumps & Micro-bumps\nThe Function: Thousands of tiny electrical connections between stacked memory chips (HBM) and the processor.\nThe Choke Point: Silver-Tin solders prevent short circuits (electromigration) at high temperatures. AI chips run hot; standard solders fail.\nThermal Management\nThe Material: TIM (Thermal Interface Material)\nThe Function: Silver-filled epoxies that sit between the chip and the metal heat sink (lid).\nThe Choke Point: Silver has the highest thermal conductivity of any metal. Without it, AI chips would overheat and throttle instantly.\n\nSilver Usage in Automobiles & Appliances User Interface\n\nThe Material: Membrane Switches (Silver Ink)\nThe Function: The “buttons” for power windows, dashboards, microwave keypads, and washing machine controls.\nThe Choke Point: These are printed circuits using silver ink on plastic. If the ink supply dries up, you cannot finish the car/appliance assembly.\nCold Weather Systems\nThe Material: Conductive Ceramic Paste\nThe Function: The orange/brown defroster lines on rear windshields and heated side mirrors.\nThe Choke Point: Specialized paste fired onto glass. A shortage here forces automakers to ship cars without “Winter Packages.”\nHVAC & Cooling\nThe Material: Brazing Alloys (2%–15% Silver)\nThe Function: Joins copper pipes in radiators, AC units, and refrigerators to prevent leaks under vibration.\nThe Choke Point: Essential for both ICE (Gas) cars and home AC units. No silver braze = leaky cooling systems.\nPower Distribution\nThe Material: Solid Silver Contacts\nThe Function: Physical contact points inside relays (turn signals, wipers, starter motors).\nThe Choke Point: Silver prevents “arcing” (sparks) when switches open/close. Lower quality metals would weld shut or catch fire.",

    "section": "A Look Back",
    "text": "A Look Back\nWhen I look back at my life and some of the current events that have come into being, I remember an event that happened at my first pharmaceutical job. I attended a presentation by Benjamin Zander, conductor of the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra. He was there to talk about his book The Art of Possibility, which he’d written with his wife Rosamund, a family therapist and painter.\nI’d never heard of him. Looking back, it was an incredible introduction to thinking differently about what’s possible.\nZander began by working with a few students from the Music School. Each one played a solo for him. He stopped them and just started talking about the emotion of that piece and how you could change it. He started talking to the musician, not about technique, but an emotional feeling. They played again and the changes were amazing. A different aspect or way of feeling greatly improved their playing style.\nHe did this with each student. Really having an impact on each performer. Then as he was talking to the crowd, he played the movie for the hidden gorilla experiment.\nYou’ve probably seen it—or think you have. A group of people in a video pass basketballs back and forth. Your job: count the number of passes.\nMidway through, a person in a gorilla suit walks directly through the middle of the players. Stops. Beats their chest. Walks off.\nAbout half the people watching miss it completely. I was in that half.\nZander told us to watch for the gorilla. I thought he was making another joke. He replayed the clip. There it was—a person in a full gorilla suit, standing in the center of the frame, impossible to miss once you knew to look for it.\nHow had I not seen that?\nThe point, Zander explained, was that you can miss things completely when you limit your sense of what’s possible. When you’re focused on counting passes, your brain filters out gorillas. Even obvious ones. Even ones standing right in front of you.\nGreat lesson. Pretty obvious once someone tells you what to look for.\nBut here was my problem—the one I’d carry for the next twenty years: I couldn’t find what I was missing.\nWhen I told my spouse or family I felt unfulfilled despite having good opportunities, their response was predictable: “What are you complaining about? You have all these opportunities.” They were right. By conventional measures, I was doing fine. Better than fine.\nLooking back at that Zander presentation, I realized something. I saw the gorilla only after Zander told me what to look for. Once you know what to look for, the problem becomes obvious. Maybe not easy to solve—but at least you have something to work on.\nBut what if no one knows what to look for? Not even you?\nWhat if your path—your specific design, your unique alignment—is something no one can describe to you because it’s uniquely yours? Your parents can’t tell you what to look for. Your boss can’t. Career counselors can’t. Because YOUR gorilla is different from theirs. Hidden in your own data. Visible only to you, once you learn to see it.\nSo how do you develop the ability to see what you don’t even know to look for?\nHow do you notice the signal when you don’t know what signal you’re searching for?\nHow do you recognize alignment when you’ve never experienced it before?",

    "section": "That’s the methodological problem.",
    "text": "That’s the methodological problem.\nAnd it’s the problem I’ve spent the last several years trying to solve—first for myself, then realizing others face the same challenge.\nI’d spent my entire career in pharmaceutical modeling, integrating disparate data—blood levels, tissue exposure, receptor binding, clinical outcomes—into coherent models that predicted drug behavior. Multiple data sources. Pattern recognition. Convergent evidence.\nWhat I didn’t realize was that I was about to apply the same methodology to a far more important question:\nNot, ”How does this drug work?”\nBut, ”How do I work?”\nWhat drives my happiness? Why am I drained despite outward success? What am I actually built for?\nThe conventional advice wasn’t working. “Follow your passion” assumes you know what your passion is. “Find what energizes you” assumes you can recognize energy when it’s not in familiar forms. “Talk to a career counselor” assumes they can see your gorilla when they’re looking at their own frameworks.\nI needed a different approach. Not someone to tell me what my gorilla looks like—methodologically, that’s impossible. But a process to help me reveal what to look for, even when I couldn’t name it.\nHere’s what is emerging:\nMultiple data sources. Don’t trust any single framework. Draw from many: analytics and intuition, conventional and unconventional, conscious and somatic. As the Zanders proposed, you can change your narrative—but you need different lenses to see which narrative might actually fit.\nPattern recognition. Look for convergence. When several independent signals point in the same direction, that overlap is meaning. When your body says one thing, your timeline shows another pattern, and an unconventional framework suggests a third angle—and they all point the same direction? That’s signal, not noise.\nThe biomarker. Your body knows before your mind does. Energy levels, time perception, physical sensations, even seemingly random emotional responses—all are data. Learn to read them. That drained feeling despite success? That’s not a character flaw. That is a system alert. It is your body’s check-engine light signaling a mismatch between your environment and your design.\nQuantified self. Track your experiences. You cannot find a pattern in a dataset that doesn’t exist. Writing these articles is how I build the dataset. I am logging the raw signal so the pattern can emerge. You’ve been making decisions, missing opportunities, feeling drawn to some things and repelled by others. Don’t be afraid to look back at where you’ve been. The pattern is there.\nThat’s how you see the unseen: by designing systems that can detect signal even in the absence of prior knowledge.\nZander could point to the gorilla because he had seen the tape before. But in your life, there is no Zander. You are watching a tape that has never been played before. So who tells you where to look?\nThis isn’t about me telling you what YOUR gorilla looks like. I can’t. Not because I’m being modest, but because it’s methodologically impossible. I found that pattern recognition and teaching energize me. You might find something completely different.\nThis isn’t “follow my path.” It’s “here’s how I found mine—use the approach to find yours.”\nOver the next several weeks, I’ll be sharing how this methodology works in practice. How I use biomarkers to navigate decisions. How I test frameworks—including unconventional ones like astrology—rigorously rather than dismissing or blindly accepting them. How I’m applying all of this right now, in real time, as systems around us shift.\nNot because I’ve arrived. But because I’m still going through it. And the methodology appears to be working.\nIf you saw my recent post about buying AI equipment last week—feeling that pressure before I consciously understood why, then watching it validate days later with China’s silver export restrictions—that’s this methodology in action.\nThe biomarker detected the pattern shift in the economic field days before I was made aware of the news cycle reporting the export restriction. That isn’t magic. That is a high-speed sensor picking up a signal before the noise of the headlines caught up to me.\nThat wasn’t luck. That’s what happens when you develop systems for seeing signal you can’t yet name.\nIf you’ve already tried following conventional advice and it didn’t work—if you’ve succeeded by conventional metrics and you’re still miserable—if you’ve realized that no one can tell you what YOUR gorilla looks like—then this is for you.\nThe good news? You don’t need someone to show you the gorilla. You need a process for developing the ability to see it yourself.\nThat’s what I’m building here. That’s what Fire in the Cave is about.\nNot inspiration. Methodology.\nLet’s figure this out together.\nSubscribe to follow along as I share the methodology—and continue documenting real-time pattern recognition as 2026 unfolds.",

Along the way, I found that these pattern recognition skills work just as well for identifying what makes me happy.\nYou may wonder why the title Fire in the Cave.\nThe image holds multiple fractals:\nPaleolithic star-painters — In her book The Human Cosmos, Jo Marchant describes how cave paintings may not just depict animals important to survival, but stars that tracked when the herds would arrive. Perhaps evidence for early pattern recognition in humans which was passed down across generations.\nPlato’s prisoners — Chained in a cave, taught the world via shadows controlled by their jailers. One escaped to the outside, discovered the lies, returned to free the others—and faced their disbelief.\nPrometheus — Stole fire from the gods to give humanity light, warmth, tools, civilization. The name means “forethought”—the one who sees what’s coming.\nHence, the atmosphere of the fire in the cave. Looking for truth not from the shadows generated, but by the fire illuminating the patterns we paint on the walls. Looking to find mine, yours, and hopefully our truth."

    "text": "Japan - Hikikomori and Satori\nIn Japan, there is the Hikikomori and Satori. The Hikikomori, first identified in the 1990s, were young people with extreme and long‐term withdrawal and avoiding obtaining an education and a career (1). In 2017, a woman interviewed became Hikikomori (The Underground World: Living in Withdrawal from Society).\n“I’d also lived as my controlling and oppressive mother had told me to, until one day I realized that there was no “me.” So I didn’t know how I wanted to live when I became an adolescent and lost track of who I was.”\nHer worst time at age 26: “How did it end up like this? Why am I such a worthless human being? There’s no room for me in society.”\n“For a while I was eating just two meals a day and couldn’t even bathe or brush my teeth. All I did was get up after noon, eat, excrete, and breathe. I was like a living corpse. I couldn’t find the tiniest bit of worth in myself. I thought my life was meaningless.”\nAccording to 2022 Japanese Cabinet Office “Survey on the Awareness and Lifestyles of Children and Young People,” 1.46 million people suffer from Hikikomori syndrome. What makes this most troubling is the 80 - 50 problem, 80 year old parents supporting 50 year old child.\nReports of Hikikomori syndrome cases were reported in other countries including (3):\n\nChina: 6.6%\nSouth Korea: 2.3%\nHong Kong: 1.9%\nUnited States: 2.7%\n\nThe “Satori sedai” or “resignation generation” was first used in 2010 to describe the youth that were pessimistic of the future and not driven to materialism (Sophie Jeong, CNN Business, “Exhausted and without hope, East Asian youth are ’lying flat’).\nA 25 yr old Satori who is consultant in Tokyo, “I spend my money only on things I like and find value [in]”. He is not interested in owning car or house.\nViews of the Satori from associate professor of anthropology at Temple University Japan Campus: “They would do what they’re expected to do, but maybe not so much beyond that. They’re less materialistic, not so interested in consumption.”\nThere are no exact numbers of Satori, but estimated to be in the millions.\nThe difference that we are observing in Japan between the Hikikomori and the Satori is the “I can’t” versus “I won’t”.\nThe Hikikomori emerged from the Employment Ice Age (1993-2004) — they followed the rules, the economy collapsed, and they broke. The Satori came of age watching the results of the Employment Ice Age. They saw the generation ahead of them do everything right and get destroyed anyway. So they made a different calculation: don’t invest in a system that already proved it will fail you.\nThe other factor affecting young temporary workers in Japan is the pressure being exerted by companies because of chronic labor shortages. Many Japanese workers are hiring resignation agencies to quit jobs (“They refused to let me go”: Japanese workers turn to resignation agencies to quit jobs).\nHead of Albatros (Resignation company): “In Japan, companies are traditionally strong …Resigning is seen as evading your responsibilities. But that is changing.”\nOne can understand the Satori point of view. From Japan, we continue to South Korea.",

If when we graduate there wouldn’t be a problem finding a job, we could smile through the difficulties we have now. But the reality is that when we graduate, finding a job will be a real problem. Even for those friends who have found a job, they worry about getting married. The ones who got married, they worry about how to buy a home. We are calling ourselves the ’n-Po‘ generation because we are giving up all the things that are of value in life.”\nProfessor of Sociology at Korea University, “Looking at the situation here the ‘whining strategy’ becomes rampant. Young people who cannot enjoy any benefits in life are feeling angry or disenfranchised and have taken to mockery and self-depreciation. The older generation is recognized for their hard work, but the younger generation is more known for inheritance than hard work when it comes to achieving success.

The rate of incidence of NEET in the UK has grown from just under 800,000 to 950,000 from 2015 to 2025.\nMegan Williams works for The Spear Programme helping Neets for more than 10 years. The charity is seeing increasing numbers of young people who are struggling with their mental health and isolation.\n“A lot of them are struggling to do day to day tasks like get out of bed, get washed, get dressed,” she said.\n“Engaging with work and education feels very far away for a lot of them.”\nOne 21‑year‑old in Leeds told the BBC he’d been out of school for years, sending applications and getting nowhere, until an employability course from the Spear Programme finally gave him his first real interview practice and a sense that he might actually have a future.\nIn parts of Europe, ‘NEET’ has become an identity as much as a category; some young people casually describe themselves as NEET or use local slang like ni‑ni in Spain and nem‑nem in Portugal—signaling that being shut out of work and school is now common enough to joke about. (Eurydice).\nResearchers tracking European NEETs find that even a short period out of work and school can leave a mark: a higher chance of future unemployment and wages that lag peers by around a fifth for as long as two decades.",

    "text": "US - Quiet Quitting\nFrom the EU across the pond to the US where we find Quiet Quitting. Quiet Quitters are Gen Z and Gen X. Both are disengaging for similar reasons as those found in Hikikomori albeit on a far less stressful scale, and the Satori of Japan. Gen X has been through layoffs, restructuring, and 1990s–2000s corporate churn. Many Gen Xers describe long histories of quitting bad jobs outright or building side‑hustle and freelance survival skills instead of trusting any single employer. Gen Z on the other hand have observed this growing up and have taken more of the Satori stance, but louder with Tik Tok videos announcing the quiet quitting.\nIn the US, it’s called ‘quiet’ because the rebellion happens in plain sight—the body is at the desk, but the spirit has already left the building.\nIn 2023, Gallup reports about 32–34% of U.S. employees engaged, 16–17% actively disengaged (“loud quitting”), and the remaining ~50% in the quiet‑quitting middle (Gallup).\nQuiet quitting Gen Z employees do the bare minimum at work. Doing exactly what the job description asks and nothing more—no unpaid overtime, no extra projects, no emotional over‑investment.\n\nA Gallup synthesis describes quiet quitters as people who “fill a seat and watch the clock,” meeting minimum requirements while being psychologically detached from their work.\nTikTok creator who helped popularize the term “quiet quitting is doing the minimum, doing your hours, doing what you’re paid for—and refusing to donate extra labor to a company that doesn’t value you.” .\nIn one recent review of Gen Z workers, researchers find that mental health and life satisfaction have fallen most among those who are working, especially women under 25, and link this to poor job quality and blocked advancement (Blanchflower & Bryson, NBER; updated manuscript; Hechinger summary).\nThe pattern is familiar: they did what was asked—degrees, résumés, side gigs—and discovered that the extra hustle doesn’t move the needle enough to justify the sacrifice, so they right‑size effort to the deal on offer (Hechinger; Gallup/CNBC on job quality).\n\nSearch for reasons why Gen X is disengaging, and what comes back reads like a corporate diagnosis looking for a corporate fix. Microsoft says 61% of Gen X managers feel overwhelmed by technology changes (Microsoft Work Trend survey summary). Deloitte says 63% are behind on retirement savings while carrying $60,000 in non-mortgage debt (summary of Deloitte findings). AARP says they’re 25% less likely to be promoted than younger colleagues despite more experience (AARP on Gen X promotions). Over half of Gen X workers are simultaneously supporting children and aging parents while working full-time, a classic sandwich-generation squeeze (Carewell / Newsweek on Gen X caregivers).\nThese describe the symptoms from the employer’s side of the desk. From the other side, it looks different.\nHillary Hattenbach, writing on Substack (We’re Gen X. We’re Not Capable of Quitting), describes the view from inside. She goes over her journey. “In the years that followed, I secured, thrived at, and quit several non-writing jobs in an attempt to figure out what would make me happy. I was too scared to pursue a writing career, terrified to fail.”\n“Eventually, I took the leap and left my steady paycheck behind, largely because I was sick of my discontent and the ripple effect it had on other aspects of my life. And now, after a half-century on the planet, I’m finally getting paid to write. I don’t make nearly as much money as I used to working for The Man, but I love what I do. Better late than never.”\nHillary’s take on this is very similar to my own experience.\nI learned from the “latch key” years about being on your own. I witnessed what the Dot.com and other economic breaks did to my parents. My father had his own business which was drained and 2008 finished it off. What was supposed to be, working for your dream could just circle down the drain. Health problems finished my father off and he never recovered financially.",

Five different cultures with five different words for the same thing.\nTangping. Hikikomori. Satori. Sampo. N-po. NEET. Gen X Quiet Quitting.\nStrip the labels away and the pattern is identical. In every country, there are two groups. The first group followed the rules, worked the hours, earned the credentials — and the economy broke them anyway. The Hikikomori. The Sampo generation. The NEETs. Gen X. They are the “I can’t” generation. Not because they lack ability, but because the system consumed their effort and returned nothing.\nThe second group watched that happen. The Satori watched the Hikikomori get destroyed. Gen Z watched Gen X grind for decades and come out behind on retirement with $60,000 in debt. China’s lying-flat youth watched their parents work 996 schedules (9:00 am to 9:00 pm, 6 days a week) to buy apartments that are now worthless. They all made the same calculation: don’t invest in a system that already proved it will fail you. They are the “I won’t” generation.\nAnd every country is getting the diagnosis wrong.\nChina calls it “unhealthy ideas” that violate socialist values. Japan classified it as a psychiatric syndrome. South Korea’s elders call it whining. Europe reduced it to a four-letter acronym on a spreadsheet. The United States turned it into a Gallup engagement metric — a problem to be optimized, a score for consultants to fix.\nEvery one of those framings puts the failure inside the person. The worker isn’t engaged enough. The young person isn’t resilient enough. The generation isn’t grateful enough.\nNone of them are asking the obvious question: What if the people are fine and the deal is broken?\nThat question is what comes next. Because if five countries with nothing in common are producing the same output, the variable isn’t culture. It isn’t work ethic. It isn’t generational character.\nIt’s the equation itself. And that equation broke everywhere at the same time, for reasons that aren’t hard to trace if you’re willing to look.\nNext: How did the math break?

    "text": "Why This Matters Beyond My Content\nI’m not announcing these sites to impress anyone with technical skill. I’m announcing them because the entire stack is free, open-source, and available to you right now.\nThe sites were built with Quarto — a publishing system designed for data scientists. It’s not WordPress. It’s not Squarespace. It was built for people who need to embed live calculations, reproducible analyses, and model outputs directly into their reports. When I show you silver price data or market structure analysis, the calculations aren’t screenshots pasted into a blog post. They’re executable code that updates when the data changes. The same rigor I apply to PK/PD modeling — show the math, let others audit it — applies to everything published here.\nThe toolchain behind it — Positron, VS Code, R Studio — is the same software I use for running local large language models, building predictive models for pharmaceutical clients, and generating figures. The publishing tool and the analysis tool are the same tool. No separate “content creation” subscription. Able to start generating content at no to low cost.\nThe decentralized site runs through Pinata (IPFS hosting) and Unstoppable Domains (blockchain-resolved .x domain). IPFS distributes content across a network of nodes rather than a single server. The domain resolves through blockchain rather than ICANN. This means no single entity — no hosting company, no domain registrar, no government agency — can take the site offline by flipping one switch.\nIf you are not familiar with IPFS hosting, I use Brave browser to load IPFS websites. I highly recommend using Brave in order to also help to control your viewing history, block ads, integrated VPN potential and able to link crypto wallet. I do not use that feature, but it is there.\nI’m spelling this out because it demonstrates something I’ll keep coming back to: the tools for sovereignty already exist. You don’t need permission. You don’t need venture capital. You don’t need a computer science degree. You need willingness to learn tools that weren’t designed to extract your attention — they were designed to extend your capability. These tools are also supported by Gemini, Claude and ChatGPT in order to get running and learning easier."

The next might be phenotypic assessment methodology or a dispatch on global youth disengagement patterns.\nThis is deliberate. Pattern recognition doesn’t happen in a single lane. You don’t discover convergent evidence by staying neatly inside one domain. The silver piece connected precious metals markets to chip manufacturing to geopolitical operations in Venezuela. The competence trap piece connected pharmaceutical modeling to personal fulfillment to biomarker detection. The connections between seemingly unrelated posts are where the signal lives.\nSubstack shows you the chronological stream — the raw dispatches as they happen. The websites show you the topology — how the dispatches connect across domains.\nThink of it as the difference between reading lab notebooks in the order they were written versus seeing the completed model that emerged from them.
