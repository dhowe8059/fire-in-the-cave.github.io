## Who I Am

I've spent most of my career modeling biological systems in pharma—teaching myself to see the hidden patterns that predict how drugs behave in the human body. 

My job was finding patterns and projecting the story: what dosage works, where it's safe, how often to give the drug. I was good at it. Companies still bring me on to consult and model their potential drugs.

And every time I do it, I feel the same thing: competent... and drained.

That observation—being successful by every external measure while feeling hollow inside—became the first data point in a different kind of modeling project. One where I am the system being studied.

## Why Fire in the Cave

The same methodology I used to decode molecular behavior could decode the behavior of my own meaning:

- **Multiple data sources** — Don't trust any single framework
- **Pattern recognition** — Look for convergence across independent signals
- **Biomarkers** — Your body knows before your mind does
- **Quantified tracking** — You cannot find a pattern in a dataset that doesn't exist

This isn't about me telling you what is the recipe for happiness. I can't. Your alignment is uniquely yours.

This is "here's how I am finding mine—use the approach to find yours."

## What I'm Building

Fire in the Cave is the methodology applied at multiple scales:

**Personal** — How to detect your own patterns, navigate your own alignment, find what actually energizes rather than drains you.

**Systemic** — The same pattern recognition that reveals personal standing waves also reveals collective ones. Education, finance, geopolitics—anywhere manufactured motion masquerades as progress.

**Architectural** — Eventually, the tools themselves.

Same fire. Different scales.
