## Welcome

I've spent most of my career in pharmaceutical companies modeling biological systems—teaching myself to see patterns in data that predict how potential drugs behave in patients. Recently, I turned that same training on my own life to discover why, despite outward success, I didn't feel happy or fulfilled. Along the way, I found that these pattern recognition skills work just as well for identifying what makes me happy.

You may wonder why the title *Fire in the Cave*.

The image holds multiple fractals:

**Paleolithic star-painters** — In her book *The Human Cosmos*, Jo Marchant describes how cave paintings may not just depict animals important to survival, but stars that tracked when the herds would arrive. Perhaps evidence for early pattern recognition in humans which was passed down across generations.

**Plato's prisoners** — Chained in a cave, taught the world via shadows controlled by their jailers. One escaped to the outside, discovered the lies, returned to free the others—and faced their disbelief.

**Prometheus** — Stole fire from the gods to give humanity light, warmth, tools, civilization. The name means "forethought"—the one who sees what's coming.

Hence, the atmosphere of the fire in the cave. Looking for truth not from the shadows generated, but by the fire illuminating the patterns we paint on the walls. Looking to find mine, yours, and hopefully our truth.

## The Standing Wave

![](images/yoke%20weight.png){width=100%}

Where many of us find ourselves:

- Expenses and costs that have made it difficult to afford what previous generations took for granted
- Following the rules of the system, but promises not kept
- Systems gamifying your attention—keeping you engaged but not empowered
- Collective changes causing anxiety and uncertainty about your future

I originally thought, like many, that old systems were simply breaking down and forcing us toward something new. But crossroads were built by Romans and kings long dead. When you only get to choose between paths others have laid, it may look like change—but you're still a user on someone else's platform.

The other possibility is what I have been calling is a standing wave. You are caught in all of your internal and external pressures that are stopping you from really finding your happy self. When you look out, you can see all of the possibility but you cannot get there.

The choice isn't between two manufactured paths. It's between accepting someone else's design or learning to recognize your own patterns—and following where they lead.

That's why I started Fire in the Cave. Because there's a difference between a crossroads and a standing wave—even though both can feel the same. A crossroads gives you someone else's options. A standing wave traps you in the illusion of motion. The real question is whether you can free yourself entirely—or just end up with a new boss, same as the old one.

## Join the Fire

If you're feeling the gap between what the system promised and what it delivered—if you've succeeded by every external measure and still feel hollow—you're not broken. You're detecting something real.
