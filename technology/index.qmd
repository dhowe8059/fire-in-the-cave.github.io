Tools for pattern recognition—and sovereignty over your own thinking.

## The Problem

Most AI tools are designed to extract value from you. Your prompts train their models. Your documents feed their datasets. Your attention is the product.

The same pattern recognition that reveals personal standing waves reveals this too: if the tool is free, you're the resource being mined.

## The Approach

I use technology to extend my pattern recognition—but on my terms:

**Local-first** — Models that run on my hardware, not someone else's cloud. My intellectual property stays mine.

**Owned infrastructure** — This site runs on Quarto and GitHub Pages. I could move it tomorrow if I needed to. No platform dependency.

**AI as collaborator, not oracle** — LLMs are statistical fits, not truth machines. Useful for extending thinking, dangerous if you mistake the output for reality.
