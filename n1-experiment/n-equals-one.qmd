*Coming soon.*

In pharmaceutical development, we run trials to find patterns. N=1 experiments apply that rigor to your own life.

This isn't "journaling" or "self-reflection" in the fuzzy sense. It's systematic:

- Define the question
- Identify measurable outcomes
- Track consistently
- Look for convergent evidence

This article will cover:

- How to design personal experiments
- What to measure and how
- Distinguishing signal from noise
- Real examples from my own n=1 studies
